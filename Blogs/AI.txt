How and where can robots assist people?
Robots are not going to replace humans; they are going to make their jobs much
more humane. Difficult, demeaning, demanding, dangerous, dull â€“ these are the
jobs robots will be taking. Productivity is one of the primary benefits of robotics
in the workplace. In Europe, the goal is to attain a 20 percent increase in productivity
by 2020. Central to achieving this is the exploration and use of robotics in the
workplace.
